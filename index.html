              <p>For this assignment, I had an initial idea to use my tattoo as a button. My computer would recognize my tattoo with the web camera and would then open a webpage. After approximately 5 hours of trying to make a reliable system, I realized that it would be to hard for me to do, so I scrapped my idea.</p>
              <p>My second idea I got was to create a chess game where you would select the square by moving your body along a ultrasonic distance sensor. Using two ultrasonic distance sensors would make two players collaborate with each other to choose a square and move the piece. The initial sketch can be seen on the right.</p>

            <h2>Prototyping - Digital</h2>
            <div class="grid">
              <div class="cell">
                <p>To start off, I used digital tools to try the concept out. I did this for two reasons. First of, it is easier for me to create digital artifacts due to my disability. Second of all, I did not have access to an Arduino since I did not own any and every Arduino in MIDDLA was taken already.</p>
                <p>I started using TinkerCAD, an online CAD service, since they have an Arduino simulator and a bunch of sensors and actuators that can be simulated. It also allowed Arduino code, which enabled me to produce working code that would be functional on an actual Arduino device. I created a simple circuit that connected two Ultrasonic Distance Sensors and wrote some code that would measure the distance in centimeters and map these to return a value between 1 and 8 (since there is 8 rows and 8 columns on a chess board). You can <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/things/fUfPmDzW0W0-chess-but-we-have-pe">play with the circuit and the code here.</a> (An account on TinkerCAD is needed)</p>
                <p>In addition to the circuit, I wrote a really simple Processing script that simply drew a chess board and highlighted the selected square. Since I could not connect the Arduino simulator to Processing, I could not do anything more with it than just showing the concept.</p>

                <p>While staying digital would be sufficient for the course, I felt like the interaction could not be experienced and therefore the hand in felt boring. Therefore I bought an Arduino to be able to implement it physically. I brought the Arduino to MIDDLA and Andreas helped me connect the circuit I made in TinkerCAD. However, there was only one Ultrasonic sensor available, so I had to work with that. I edited the code so I could send the data to Processing. You can see the interaction on the next slide.</p>
                <p>I did some final polishing on the Processing sketch to make sure it looked nice. I also made it recieve data from the Arduino to be able to use that in my Processing sketch. Since I only had one sensor, I made that so you could move vertically and horisontally by implementing a simple timer that would change how the input would be used (vertically or horisontally). It was definately more janky than two sensors but it had to suffice due to the lack of sensors</p>

            <h2>Result and design critique</h2>
            <div class="grid">
              <div class="cell">
                <p>For the result, I am quite happy with the result. There is some issues with the sensor since it did not read always read the values accurately. There are mainly two potentional issues that could cause this. I did not do any data processing such as sampling, which could cause to inaccuracies. The sensor could also be broken, but the one I used was all new, so that should not be an issue unless it is a manufacturing issue. For a final version, this needs to be addressed.</p>
                <p>The critique I got was good. The interaction felt interesting and self explainatory, which was nice to hear. I explained the original idea with two sensors, which they all understood. I got some critique about not using a proper ideation process, which would have helped me with my time. As mentioned, I tried to make an interaction with my tattoo, but when I realized that it was too inaccurate, I went back to square one and had no idea what to do. This chess idea was just an Heureika moment and I was just lucky that I got the idea. Otherwise, I'd probably be stuck and just trying to get something to hand in, which is a recipe for bad design. If I used proper ideation methods, I would have came up with several ideas that I could fall back to. I did not have this and was "just lucky" to get another doable idea in the time frame I had.</p>

              <h2>Ideation</h2>
              <p>For this project, me and my teammate met up and did some brainstorming. I did have an idea based on personal experience and Deep Pressure Therapy. The basic idea was a wristband that would hug the wearer to reduce stress. We took it a step further and set our target group to individuals with Autism, since they can be sensitive to impressions.</p>
              <p>Our initial idea was to work with sound levels since people with Autism is known to be sensitive to loud sounds, but due to the lack of sensors, we switched to light instead. My teammate knew a person with Autism that was sensitive to high light levels, so we chose to focus on that.</p>

              <h1>Theory</h1>
              <h2>The hug machine</h2>
              <p>Before discussing what Deep Pressure Therapy is, let us look where it all started.</p>
              <p>Temple Grandin, born in 1947, is a scientist which was not diagnosed with autism until her 40s, and is one of the first people that documented how it was like living with autism (barncroft). Her experiences led her to develop the Hug Machhine. It all started on her aunts' farm, where she noticed that cattles passing through the chutes was calmer when they had passed compared to before, and constructed a similar construction in hopes to calm down herself. The hug machine is a construction that squeezes the body evenly, providing pressure on the whole body. This is a tool used today to calm down people with autism.</p>

                <h2>What is Deep Pressure Therapy?</h2>
                <p>Deep Pressure Therapy is, simply put, the use of pressure in the form of stroking, hugging or any form of pressure on the skin. The act of swaddling a baby to calm it down is a form of Deep Pressure Therapy. The most popular commercial product on the market utilizing this is weighted blankets.</p>
                <p>On a more biological level, when deep pressure is applied to the skin, the sympathetic nervous system deactivates and the parasympathetic nervous system activates. The sympathetic nervous system is responsible for the "fight or flight" response and is activated during stress, fright and anxiety. The parasympathetic nervous system is the opposite, and triggers when you feel calmness. It releases Dopamine, which gives you the feeling of pleassure and satisfaction, and Serotonin, which contributes to a stable mood, happiness and even better sleep. Since deep pressure activates the release of these hormones, it is clear that the user will feel more calm.</p>

                <h2>Personal experience</h2>
                <p>As a person living with Cerebal Palsy since birth, I struggle daily with involuntary muscle movements and will probably do it all my life. While it is hard to explain how it feels to live with it, one can understand that it is energy consuming. I would like to categorize calmness into two categories, relative calmness and true calmness.</p>
                <p>Relative calmness is a state where I am relatively calm and often look calm, but my muscles are still pretty stiff inside me, which one can feel if they would "investigate" my muscles. True calmness, on the other hand, is a state where even my muscles are calm and is "truly calm". This is a state that I strive for, but rarely is in.</p>
                <p>Most of my calmness is in the relative calmness state, and to turn that to true calmness, tools such as weighted blankets is more often than not required to achieve that.</p>
                <p>While this is not exactly related to the project, I think this gives more perspective to the design and highlights the true value proposition that the proposed design holds. I truly believe that there are room for research in this area, which I may or may not dive into in my master degree project.</p>

                <h2>Prototyping - The circuit</h2>
                <p>We started of by constructing our circuit that our wristband would use. The circuit consists of a light sensor and a 180 degree servo motor. The arduino was programmed so when the light sensor would record a value, the servo would turn. This servo would be responsible for the hug of the wristband.</p>
