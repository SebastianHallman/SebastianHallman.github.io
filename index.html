              <p>For this assignment, I had an initial idea to use my tattoo as a button. My computer would recognize my tattoo with the web camera and would then open a webpage. After approximately 5 hours of trying to make a reliable system, I realized that it would be to hard for me to do, so I scrapped my idea.</p>
              <p>My second idea I got was to create a chess game where you would select the square by moving your body along a ultrasonic distance sensor. Using two ultrasonic distance sensors would make two players collaborate with each other to choose a square and move the piece. The initial sketch can be seen on the right.</p>

                <p>To start off, I used digital tools to try the concept out. I did this for two reasons. First of, it is easier for me to create digital artifacts due to my disability. Second of all, I did not have access to an Arduino since I did not own any and every Arduino in MIDDLA was taken already.</p>
                <p>I started using TinkerCAD, an online CAD service, since they have an Arduino simulator and a bunch of sensors and actuators that can be simulated. It also allowed Arduino code, which enabled me to produce working code that would be functional on an actual Arduino device. I created a simple circuit that connected two Ultrasonic Distance Sensors and wrote some code that would measure the distance in centimeters and map these to return a value between 1 and 8 (since there is 8 rows and 8 columns on a chess board). You can <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/things/fUfPmDzW0W0-chess-but-we-have-pe">play with the circuit and the code here.</a></p>
                <p>In addition to the circuit, I wrote a really simple processing script that simply drew a chess board and highlighted the selected square. Since I could not connect the Arduino simulator to processing, I could not do anything more with it than just showing the concept.</p>
